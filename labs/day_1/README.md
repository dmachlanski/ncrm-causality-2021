# Labs day 1 - Machine Learning

We will put into practice all the stuff discussed in day 1 lecture. We start with a gentle introduction to numpy and matplotlib - the two python packages that will allow us to handle and plot data. We will specifically focus on those aspects of the packages that we will need throughout the course. We then take a closer look at the two classic machine learning tasks: regression and classification. We will approach each of the two by first going through an example dataset together, step by step, followed by an exercise involving another dataset where everyone can try to perform a similar analysis but on their own, with our assistance as needed, of course. All incorporated datasets are available under [data](data) directory.
